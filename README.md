# Election_Analysis
We were asked by an empoloyee of the Colorado Board of Elections to audit a recent congressional election, in two separate phases: candidate results and county results.

## Project Overview (Candidate Results)
In the first phase of the election analysis, we were asked to perform the following tasks:
1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Project Summary
The analysis of the election shows that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
- There were three(3) candidates:
    - Charles Casper Stockham
    - Diana DeGette 
    - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candidate results were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 votes.
    - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes.
    - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 votes.
- The winner of the election was:
    - Diana DeGette, who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes.

## Challenge Overview (County Results)
Once we provided the CBE with the candidate results, they asked us to perform a similar analysis, this time regarding votes cast by county. Using the same dataset, the second analysis included the following:
1. Get a complete list of counties where votes were cast.
2. Calculate the total number of votes each county cast.
3. Calculate the percentage of votes each county cast.
4. Determine the county with the highest voter turnout. 

## Challenge Summary
The analysis of the election (369,711 votes cast) shows that:
- Three(3) counties were analyzed:
    - Jefferson County
    – Denver County
    – Arapahoe County
- Each county had the following number and percentage of overall votes:
    - Jefferson County cast 38,555 votes, or 10.5%.
    – Denver County cast 306,055 votes, or 82.8%.
    – Arapahoe County cast 24,801 votes, or 6.7%.
- The county with the highest votes cast was:
    - Denver County, with 306,055 votes cast, or 82.8% of the 368,711 votes.

## Further Potential Analysis
If desired by the CBE, we could further modify our code to perform a deeper analysis to identify:
– Which candidates were voted for in each county
– The number and percentage of votes for each candidate by county
– The winning candidate for each county
– The winning county for each candidate
